# CRT shader for Godot

This is a CRT shader for Godot, based on [Mattias Gustavsson](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson)'s CRT shader, which can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sSGDK). Mattias has since made alterations and improvements to this shader that can be found elsewhere, but those improvements are not included in this shader! The shader is intended to be used as a custom postprocessing shader.

This shader has been tested with Godot 4.1. For usage instructions, please refer to [the Godot documentation on custom postprocessing shaders](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.1/tutorials/shaders/custom_postprocessing.html).

At the moment, this shader is not available in the Godot asset store. This might change later!
